# Godot: Stair-stepping Demo
A demonstration of character stair-stepping without using Separation Rays.
Utilizes raycasts and body_test_moves to get step heights, avoid walls, avoid steep slopes, and translate the player up a step.

Features:
- Stair-stepping with customizable step height
- Basic first-person camera smoothing

You can install by downloading and importing the addon folder into your Godot project, or by installing from the asset library.

To enable the debug view for collisions, go to the top bar, click "Debug", and enable "Visible Collision Shapes".

Finally, beware! This is pretty hacky (well, i think it is anyways)!
